# Description:
The project is an innovative educational platform that draws inspiration from the Coursera model but incorporates essential innovations and is designed to enhance the teaching and learning experience. Professors can create and manage courses, which are accessible to students globally. A feedback system enables students to rate courses and professors, ensuring quality and continuous improvement. Additionally, an employer hiring module facilitates the recruitment of students and gathers recruiter feedback, which is shared with professors to help refine their courses. Comprehensive analytics were implemented to provide valuable insights into faculty and student data, further optimizing the platformâ€™s effectiveness.

# Features:
